##Expnsr Web Application

Expnsr will be a checkbook register and budget planning application built using a
RESTful API using Laravel 5 and dingo-api with jwt-auth to authenticate the API.

This serves as the front end for the API for the users, and I hope to eventually
add more functionality and port this application over to Android and iOS.

This project was created from the [preboot/angular-webpack](https://github.com/preboot/angular-webpack)
starter project.
